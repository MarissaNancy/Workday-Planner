# Workday Planner

## Description
This weeks homework is to create a simple calender application that allows users to save events for their work day. We have to modify code to make the application work and users should be able to save their events for each hour of the day. We have to use what we've learned so far along with moments.js.

## User Story
An employee with a busy schedule wants to be able to add important events to a daily planner. In doing this we will be helping emloyees manage their time better.

## Directions
Using what we've learned so far we have to alter code to create a simple calender application. The user should be able to add events to their daily planner by hour.If they refresh the browser the users input should still be displayed. Using moments.js we should also display the day and timeblocks for current time.

## Acceptance Criteria
When a user opens the browser and is presented with a daily schedule. Once the window opens the user should be presented with current day at the top. Upon scrolling down the user is presented with timeblocks for standard business hours. The timeblocks should be color coded to show present, past or future time. If user clicks on a timeblock and can enter an event and save event for that timeblock. Event should also be saved in local storage so if the page is refreshed the saved event still exsist.
